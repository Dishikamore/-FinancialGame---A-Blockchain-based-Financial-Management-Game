# FinancialGame - A Blockchain-based Financial Management Game

## Project Description
**FinancialGame** is a simple blockchain-based financial literacy game built using Solidity. The game allows users to manage their income, set budgets, add expenses, and save money in a decentralized environment. This smart contract simulates basic personal finance management, helping users understand how to manage finances using blockchain technology.

The game operates on the Ethereum blockchain and is controlled by the contract owner (typically the user who deploys the contract). The player can update their budget, track expenses, and savings while ensuring they don't exceed their set limits.

## Contract Address
Once deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, the contract will have a unique address. Please replace the following placeholder with the actual contract address once deployed:

```
Contract Address: 0x9Ca9B0b18c3292B54dB7c1aE5403957bd30e854F
```
## Project Vision
The **FinancialGame** aims to provide users with an engaging way to learn financial literacy concepts, including budgeting, saving, and tracking expenses. By interacting with a smart contract, users can better understand how blockchain can be applied to everyday financial management.

The long-term vision is to expand this game to include more complex financial features such as investment management, interest, income changes, and user-specific financial records.
## Key Features
- **Income Management**: The game is initialized with a specific income value, which determines the user's starting balance.
- **Budget Management**: Users can set and modify their monthly budget within the contract, ensuring it does not exceed the available income.
- **Expense Management**: Users can add expenses within their budget, tracking how much they spend during the game.
- **Savings Tracker**: The contract allows users to save part of their balance, transferring funds into a "savings" account.
- **Balance and Financial Tracking**: Real-time tracking of the player's available balance, expenses, and savings.
